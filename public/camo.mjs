// How a tank body's camo is generated from a player's colour. The pixel and
// canvas work lives in render.js; everything here is arithmetic, so the rule
// can be checked against the real texture without a browser -- see
// scripts/test-camo.mjs.

// BZFlag paints one finished camo texture per team and draws it unmodulated --
// TankSceneNode.cxx:1278, "do not use color modulation with tank textures" --
// so the four patches on a tank differ in hue and saturation, not only in
// brightness. purple_tank.png runs from a saturated violet to a near-colourless
// (129,120,138); blue_tank.png sets a deep blue against a cyan highlight and a
// grey-blue shadow. That works upstream because eight teams need eight files.
//
// bzo gives every player a distinct shade of their team's colour, so there is
// no file to paint per player and the body texture is generated from the colour
// instead. Tinting one grey ramp -- which is what bzo did before -- can only
// ever produce a single hue, and the camo reads as one flat colour dimmed and
// brightened.
//
// So a source texture is retargeted in HSV rather than tinted: its hue is
// rotated until its own average lands on the player's, and each texel keeps the
// offset it had from that average. A patch painted above the source hue stays
// above the player's, one painted below stays below, and the two show up as
// different shades on every tank. Saturation rides along unchanged, which makes
// the source's own saturation the mask for how much a texel follows the player
// at all: a strongly coloured patch becomes the player's colour, and one the
// artist left near grey stays near grey on every tank in the game. Value is
// kept as painted, so the camo's light and dark read the same whoever wears it.
export const CAMO_SOURCE_TEXTURE = '/textures/blue_tank.png';
// Of upstream's seven, blue_tank.png is the one whose saturation spans the
// widest range -- a (64,64,80) shadow at 0.20 against a 0.89 body -- so it has
// both the near-grey the rule needs to leave alone and the strong hue the rule
// needs to move. green_tank.png and hunter_tank.png are saturated almost
// everywhere and would leave nothing fixed; purple_tank.png is so grey that
// little would move. Nothing outside this block knows which file it is: any
// painted camo works, and a hand-drawn one can replace it by changing the path.

// Saturation is stretched rather than scaled, along two axes.
//
// Without any of this the average tank is paler than the colour it was
// assigned: blue_tank.png averages a saturation of 0.63, so a player given pure
// red gets a tank averaging (172,68,73) where the flat tint this replaced gave
// (170,0,0). It reads as washed out rather than as that player's red.
//
// It cannot be corrected by a plain multiply. A fully saturated colour sits on
// the edge of the gamut, and the only picture whose average is exactly
// (255,0,0) is one painted (255,0,0) everywhere -- so lifting the average with
// one gain also lifts the areas that were meant to stay colourless, and the
// tank gets more saturated and *less* varied at the same time. Over the source,
// by gain alone:
//
//   gain   mean saturation   greyest texel   span
//   1.0    0.63              0.20            0.72
//   2.2    0.81              0.31            0.69
//   3.2    0.92              0.45            0.55
//
// So the gain is paired with an exponent that pulls the bottom of the range
// down as the gain pushes the top up. Saturation becomes `s ** CONTRAST * GAIN`:
// the exponent costs the near-grey texels far more than the strong ones, and
// the gain then puts the strong ones back at full. The average lands where a
// plain gain of 2.2 put it, with the quiet areas much quieter:
//
//   contrast  gain   mean   greyest texel   span
//   1.0       2.2    0.81   0.31            0.69
//   1.4       2.8    0.80   0.19            0.81
//   1.6       3.2    0.80   0.15            0.85
//   2.0       4.5    0.81   0.11            0.89
//
// 1.6 is where the quiet areas are plainly colourless without the rest of the
// tank being driven so hard that the patches stop differing from each other.

// How much of that colour the brightest areas give back up.
//
// Saturation is scaled by `1 - CAMO_HIGHLIGHT_WASH * value`, so a texel keeps
// its colour where the camo is dark and loses it where the camo is lit. That is
// how a lit surface behaves -- the brighter a highlight, the closer it runs to
// white -- and it is the second axis the patches vary along, so two of them at
// the same saturation in the source still come out visibly different. On the
// source it separates the cyan highlight from the body beside it, 0.67 against
// a fully saturated 1.00.
//
// It works against the gain, since the highlight is a fifth of the tank and a
// washed one pulls the average down with it. All three are set together, and
// the average a player is recognised by is what limits how far this can go.
export const CAMO_HIGHLIGHT_WASH = 0.45;

// Rogue. Upstream draws rogues from rogue_tank.png, and that file is painted in
// plain greys -- mean (55,55,55), no saturation anywhere in it, a mean luminance
// of 0.217. A rogue tank upstream has no hue at all, and the team's yellow lives
// only on the radar and the scoreboard (Team.cxx:20), which is where a rogue is
// picked out of a list rather than off the field.
//
// bzo keeps rogue yellow in both of those places for the same reason, and
// brings the tank itself back in line here. Zero, not a trace: a rogue carrying
// any fraction of its assigned colour reads as a yellow tank, because every
// rogue shade bzo hands out is a yellow one. The value scale is what puts the
// result on upstream's own brightness -- a rogue comes out averaging (47,47,47)
// to (66,66,66) against upstream's (55,55,55), depending on how light the shade
// behind it was.
