# Audio

The sound effects in `public/audio/` come from upstream BZFlag
(`bzflag/data/*.wav`) so that bzo sounds like the game it mirrors. Below is
every sample, the name `playSound()` asks for it by, the BZFlag `SFX_*` code
it answers, and the event bzo plays it for. The manifest in `public/audio.js`
holds the same mapping in code, with each sound's distance and volume.

This lives here rather than beside the samples because everything under
`public/` is a document root: a README next to the assets it describes is served
to every client, and every edit to it changes the build id and reloads them.

**Levels mirror BZFlag exactly, and there is no per-sound volume.** BZFlag scales
every sample only by distance and one global setting; the samples are pre-mixed
relative to each other, so adding per-sound gain undoes that balance. Its
attenuation, from `getWorldStuff()` in `src/bzflag/sound.cxx`, is
`amplitude = d < 86.4 ? 1 : 86.4 / d`, where `86.4` is 20 BZFlag tank radii
(`20 * 4.32`). That is the Web Audio `inverse` distance model with
`refDistance = 86.4` and `rolloffFactor = 1`, which reproduces the curve exactly.
The constant scales with the world, not the vehicle, so it stays `4.32` even
though a bzo tank has radius 2. Tune `MASTER_VOLUME` in `public/audio.js`, not
individual sounds.

## Shipped but not triggered

`public/audio/` holds every `.wav` upstream's `data/` does, so the two sets can
be compared file for file. Four of them have nothing in bzo that plays them, and
so are deliberately absent from `GAME_SOUNDS`: only what is registered there is
preloaded, and the service worker caches `/audio/` on first use rather than up
front, so an unregistered file is never fetched.

| file | BZFlag SFX | why bzo has no trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `spree1.wav` | -- | upstream ships all four and references none of them anywhere in its tree: they appear only in `data/Makefile.am`. There is no upstream behaviour to mirror |
| `spree2.wav` | -- | as above |
| `spree3.wav` | -- | as above |
| `spree4.wav` | -- | as above |
