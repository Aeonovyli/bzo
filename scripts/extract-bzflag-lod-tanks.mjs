// Builds public/obj/bzflag-medium.obj and bzflag-low.obj from the BZFlag
// source tree, which is where upstream's tank actually lives.
//
// misc/tank.obj -- which bzflag.obj was made from -- is packaged but never
// read by the client: nothing compiles or loads it. What upstream draws is
// built in C++, one function per part per level of detail, in
// src/geometry/models/tank/. Those functions are immediate-mode OpenGL with
// the geometry written out as literals, so they can be read as data.
//
// Set BZFLAG_SRC to point at a BZFlag checkout; it defaults to ~/bzflag.
//
//   BZFLAG_SRC=~/bzflag node scripts/extract-bzflag-lod-tanks.mjs
//
// All three levels of detail, including the high one. bzflag.obj is upstream's
// high geometry too, but split into bzo's three-part tread convention -- a
// middle band with a cap at each end -- where upstream has one casing per
// side. So it never gets the one-piece treatment the other two do, and its
// belt is textured by three objects that each scale their own way. This
// extracts upstream's own shape instead, with the same handling as the
// cheaper two.
