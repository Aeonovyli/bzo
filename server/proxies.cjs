// `proxies` in `server.json`: which real BZFlag servers this instance may
// carry a browser to, as a map from the name a player sees to the address bzo
// dials.
//
//   "proxies": {
//     "bz.rikers.org:5154": "127.0.0.1:5154",
//     "bz-test:5155":       "127.0.0.1:5155"
//   }
//
// The two are different addresses and both are needed. The key is the
// identity: for a publicized target it is exactly the `host:port` the public
// BZFlag list carries -- its own `-publicaddr` -- so the bzo row and the
// bzflag row read the same string and a player comparing them sees one
// server. It is also what the cached world is filed under, so a shared
// `?viewmap=` link names something another bzo could re-ask. The value is how
// this instance reaches it, which is operator configuration and nothing a
// player is ever shown.
//
// The map is also the allowlist. A target not named here cannot be proxied,
// linked to, or logged in to, which is what keeps `?proxy=` from being an
// invitation to dial anywhere.
//
// See `docs/proxy.md`.

// A key's host has to survive `remoteMapFileName`, which replaces anything
// outside this set with `_` -- a name that did not round-trip would be a
// `?viewmap=` link nobody could re-import. bzfs is IPv4-only, so there is no
// bracketed IPv6 form to allow for.

// verifies when bzfs sees the connection arrive from one of these, so a
// public dial address is worth warning about -- though it is not an error,
// since a target that is not publicized never checks a token at all.

// browsers show it back as `%3A`, which makes a link somebody was meant to
// share look like an error; `_` survives a round trip through every address
// bar untouched. It is also the spelling the cached world already uses
// (`import-<host>_<port>.bzw`), so the link and the file read the same way,
// while `host:port` stays the identity -- what `/list` shows, what the
// operator configures, and what a bzflag list row says.
